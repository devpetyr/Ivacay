                           <p>Please note, it is the third-party Service Providers registered on our Platform who provide a description of
                               their tours, activities, packages, tour guide services, and other services and offerings via their Listings.
                               These Service Providers are independent individuals or businesses who have created an account on our
                               platform to provide their services, and these Service Providers are not under the control of Ivacay or
                               associated with Ivacay in any manner. Therefore, Ivacay disclaims all guarantees and warranties in respect
                               to the completeness, accuracy, or quality of such services provided by the Service Providers. Although we
                               require the Service Providers to post a materially complete and accurate description of their services, we do
                               not warrant that such description will always be accurate, complete, reliable, safe, current or error-free.

                               respect shall lie with the concerned Service Provider.</p>

                               cancellations within a period of 2 (two) hours calculated from the moment the service is
                               booked, full refund of the booking price will be made to the buyer. However, in cases of
                               cancellations after 2 (two) hours or more or in case of no-show, no refund of the booking
